# CardboardProject
Google Cardboard VR project made with the Unity3d engine. The user is stuck inside its computer and drive around its filefolders. If he falls, he is teleported into the trash where he had to find the exit.

The user control its car with another android device which will act as a wheel. In order to play, both devices must launch the program. On the startup screen, you can choose if you play the wheel or the screen. Both devices must then join the same room on the network screen. Note it require both device to have an internet connexion.
